# A MATLAB Implementation of Circularity Indicators of Thermodynamical Material Networks
This repository contains the source code of the paper "Circularity of Thermodynamical Material Networks: Indicators, Examples, and Algorithms" authored by Federico Zocco and available at: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2209.15051.pdf. 

The paper proposes the circularity indicators summarized below by leveraging the formalism of thermodynamical material networks.

If you use this code, please consider citing the corresponding paper mentioned above.

## Getting started
Example_1.m and Example_2.m generate the results showed in the paper. Other mass-flow matrices could be considered.
Debugging.m illustrates the calculation of the indicators for simple graphs. See the code for more information.
