# A MATLAB implementation of circularity indicators of thermodynamical material networks
The repository contains the source code of the paper "Circularity of Thermodynamical Material Networks: Indicators, Examples, and Algorithms" authored by Federico Zocco, Beatrice Smyth, and Pantelis Sopasakis and available at: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2209.15051.pdf. 

If you use this code, please consider citing the corresponding paper mentioned above.

## Getting started
Example_1.m and Example_2.m generate the results showed in the paper. Other mass-flow matrices could be considered.
Debugging.m illustrates the calculation of the indicators for simple graphs. See the code for more information.
