# A MATLAB-Simulink Implementation of Circularity Indicators of Thermodynamical Material Networks
This repository contains the source code of the paper "Circularity of Thermodynamical Material Networks: Indicators, Examples, and Algorithms" authored by Federico Zocco and available at: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2209.15051.pdf. If you use this code, please consider citing the corresponding paper.

The paper proposes the circularity indicators summarized below by leveraging graph theory and the formalism of thermodynamical material networks.

The paper also provides the dynamical equations for modeling highly dynamic stocks and flows of solid materials. The simulation outputs are shown below.

## Getting Started
### Case of Fluid Materials
"Example_1.m" and "Example_2.m" generate the results shown in the paper. Other mass-flow matrices could be considered.
Debugging.m illustrates the calculation of the indicators for simple graphs. See the code for more information. 

### Case of Solid Materials
The Simulink file "NumericalExampleWithSolids.slx" generates the results reported in the paper. Before running the Simulink model, initialize it by running the script "NumericalExampleWithSolids_param.m".
